# REGEM

REGEM (RE-analysis of GEM summary statistics) is a software program for re-analyzing large-scale gene-environment interaction testing results, including multi-exposure interaction, joint, and marginal tests. It uses results directly from [GEM](https://github.com/large-scale-gxe-methods/GEM) output.

### Command Line Options
Once REGEM is compiled, the executable ./REGEM can be used to run the program.
For a list of options, use ```./REGEM --help```.

     <summary> <b>List of Options</b> </summary>

```
General Options:
 
   --help                
   		Prints available options and exits.  
    
   --version             
   		Prints the version of REGEM and exits.


File Options:
   --input-file        
   		Path to the input file containing GEM results.  
    
   --out  
   		Full path and extension to where REGEM output results.  
   		Default: regem.out  
    
   --output-style  
   		Modifies the output of REGEM. Must be one of the following:
   			minimum: Output the summary statistics for only the GxE and marginal G terms.
   			   meta: 'minimum' output plus additional fields for the main G and any GxCovariate terms.
   				 For a robust analysis, additional columns for the model-based summary statistics will be included.
   			   full: 'meta' output plus additional fields needed for re-analyses of a subset of interactions.
   			Default: full  


Input File Options:  

   --exposure-names      
   		One or more column names in the input file naming the exposure(s) to be included in interaction tests.  
        
   --int-covar-names     
   		Any column names in the input file naming the covariate(s) for which interactions should be included for adjustment (mutually exclusive with --exposure-names).


Centering Conversion Options:

   --center-in
      A value of 0, 1, or 2 representing the centering status in the GEM output file: 0 indicates no centering, 1 indicates centering of all exposures and covariates, and 2 indicates centering of interaction covariates only.


   --center-out
      A value of 0, 1, or 2 representing the centering status in the REGEM output file: 0 for no centering, 1 to center all exposures and covariates, and 2 to center only the interaction covariates.


   --mean-value
      Pairs of variable names and their mean values, with each pair connected by an equal sign.

```
</details>

<br /> 

### Input File

REGEM takes as input an output file from a GEM run with the --output-style flag set to "full". The --output-style flag is available in GEMv1.4.1 and later versions of the software.

<br />

### Output File

REGEM will write results to the output file specified with the --out parameter (or 'regem.out' if no output file is specified).
Below are details of the possible column headers in the output file.

```diff 
SNPID              - The SNP identifier as retrieved from the genotype file.
CHR                - The chromosome of the SNP.
POS                - The physical position of the SNP. 
Non_Effect_Allele  - The allele not counted in association testing.  
Effect_Allele      - The allele that is counted in association testing.  
N_Samples          - The number of samples without missing genotypes.
AF                 - The allele frequency of the effect allele.
N_catE_*           - The number of non-missing samples in each combination of strata for all of the categorical exposures and interaction covariates.
AF_catE_*          - The allele frequency of the effect allele for each combination of strata for all of the catgorical exposure or interaction covariate.

Beta_Marginal           - The coefficient estimate for the marginal genetic effect (i.e., from a model with no interaction terms).
SE_Beta_Marginal        - The model-based SE associated with the marginal genetic effect estimate.  
robust_SE_Beta_Marginal - The robust SE associated with the marginal genetic effect estimate.

Beta_G             - The coefficient estimate for the genetic main effect (G).
Beta_G-*           - The coefficient estimate for the interaction or interaction covariate terms.
SE_Beta_G          - Model-based SE associated with the the genetic main effect (G).  
SE_Beta_G-*        - Model-based SE associated with any GxE or interaction covariate terms.
Cov_Beta_G_G-*     - Model-based covariance between the genetic main effect (G) and any GxE or interaction covariate terms.  
Cov_Beta_G-*_G-*   - Model-based covariance between any GxE or interaction covariate terms.
robust_SE_Beta_G   - Robust SE associated with the the genetic main effect (G).  
robust_SE_Beta_G-* - Robust SE associated with any GxE or interaction covariate terms.
robust_Cov_Beta_G_G-*   - Robust covariance between the genetic main effect (G) and any GxE or interaction covariate terms.
robust_Cov_Beta_G-*_G-* - Robust covariance between any GxE or interaction covariate terms. 

P_Value_Marginal           - Marginal genetic effect p-value from model-based SE.
P_Value_Interaction        - Interaction effect p-value (K degrees of freedom test of interaction effect) from model-based SE. (K is number of major exposures)
P_Value_Joint              - Joint test p-value (K+1 degrees of freedom test of genetic and interaction effect) from model-based SE.
robust_P_Value_Marginal    - Marginal genetic effect p-value from robust SE.
robust_P_Value_Interaction - Interaction effect p-value from robust SE.
robust_P_Value_Joint       - Joint test p-value (K+1 degrees of freedom test of genetic and interaction effect) from robust SE.
```

<br />

### Examples  

```unix
./REGEM --input-file gem.out --exposure-names cov1 --out regem_cov1.out

To change the centering status of cov1 from 0 to 1:
./REGEM --input-file gem.out --exposure-names cov1 --out regem_cov1.out --center-in 0 --center-out 1 --mean-value cov1=0.5

```
